A Parking Fee Calculation System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helps automate the process of calculating parking charges based on the duration of a vehicle's stay. The system allows users to enter details such as vehicle type, vehicle number, entry time, and exit time, and then dynamically computes the total parking duration. JavaScript is used to apply predefined hourly rates for different vehicle types (car, bike, truck, bus) and calculate the corresponding parking fee. The system also maintains a parking history table, storing details of previous entries for easy reference. CSS ensures a visually appealing and responsive interface, enhancing user experience. This system can be further improved with features like real-time validation, automatic time inputs, and local storage for data persistence, making it an efficient solution for parking management. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
